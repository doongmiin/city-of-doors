I'd rather be a fool than in a cage, it is the risks led by the heart that set us free. But then again, Sigil was no ordinary cage. Idyllic moments flow through the mind of Fama Flintstrike as he dreams of far off places. Moments that he shall never forget, nor fail to recall when his strength is waning. For on that fateful day, the one that changed the directory of his life, he could not forget the golden glint of the strangers eyes. Nor the way he called Fama, “the blaze that dares to light up the night." 

In the bustling streets of vibrant Waterdeep, where Fama grew up and roamed, he always sought thrills and treasures. His nimble fingers had become quite adept at the art of pickpocketing unsuspecting individuals, and he reveled in the satisfaction that came with such a skill. On what seemed like an average day, Fama set his sights on a seemingly ordinary stranger, a figure lost amidst the crowds.

With swift precision, Fama moved in for the steal, but little did he know that fate had a different plan in store for him. As his hand dipped into the stranger's pocket, a sensation of electric energy coursed through his veins, and a mischievous grin spread across the stranger’s face. Startled, Fama tried to retreat, but found himself rooted to the spot, as if held by an unseen force. This stranger, revealing himself as a god of trickery, saw potential in Fama’s daring nature and unmatched dexterity. Instead of condemning him for his misdeeds, this god recognized an opportunity. With a sly chuckle, he revealed his true identity and spoke with a voice that carried both amusement and wisdom.

“Ah, Fama, your skills are impressive, but misdirected,” the god said, his eyes gleaming with mischief. “You have stumbled upon a path that I can help you master. Instead of a punishment, I offer you a chance to become something greater-a legend among men.”

Fama’s disbelief gave way to curiosity as the god shared tales of rogues who had shaped history with their cunning and stealth. He spoke of heists and daring escapades, showcasing a world beyond anything Fama had ever imagined. The god promised to train him in the ways of trickery, unlocking his potential and molding him into a rogue of unparalleled finesse.

Unable to resist the lure of his extraordinary opportunity, Fama accepted the gods' proposal. Under the gods guidance, he delved into the intricate world of subterfuge and deception, honing his skills and learning secrets that would make him the envy of those in his tribe. Each day brought new challenges and lessons, pushing him to the edge of his abilities, and reshaping him into the soulknife that he is today.  

This continued for weeks until the gods' presence vanished as though he was never there. From the pickpocket stranger, Fama had unknowingly stolen not just a trinket, but a destiny. As he embraced his new path, he discovered that sometimes, the greatest rewards come from the most unexpected encounters. And so, with a god of trickery as his guide, Fama embarked on a journey where the lines of larceny and legend blurred, forever changing the course of his life. 

It wasn’t until many years later that Fama would feel a tug at his heart, and an electric energy emanate from the stolen object, one that he always kept on him, that would push him to seek out The City of Doors.
