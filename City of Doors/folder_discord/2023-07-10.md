In the city of Sigil, there exists a discreet courier whose sole purpose is to deliver enigmatic notes to individuals. This courier traverses the winding streets and shadowy alleys, hidden in a cloak of secrecy. His target one 154 Shatterbone Street, within the Hive.

Carrying an ornate satchel embossed with arcane symbols, the courier embarks on a journey from the depths of the Hall of Records. This ancient repository of knowledge holds the secrets of Sigil's past and future.

The notes, written with ink of ethereal hue, bear cryptic messages that summon Fama and Barnaby to attend secret meetings. Each message unfolds with precision, revealing a time, a place, and a hidden purpose behind the summons.

Some speculate that the courier is an agent of Sigil's unseen governing body, entrusted with the task of orchestrating covert gatherings.
Nestled amidst the labyrinthine streets and ethereal mists, this ancient edifice embodies the accumulated wisdom of countless ages.

Its imposing facade, adorned with intricate carvings and symbols, hints at the hidden depths within. Tall, arched doorways crafted from weathered stone grant passage into a realm of esoteric knowledge and enigmatic power.

Stepping inside, one finds themselves encompassed by a vast expanse of towering shelves, stretching towards a ceiling veiled in shadows. Countless scrolls, tomes, and manuscripts, meticulously organized and preserved, line the shelves, holding the accumulated lore of Sigil and realms beyond.

The air within is heavy with the scent of aged parchment and ink, lending an aura of reverence to the seekers of knowledge who venture into its hallowed halls. Dimly lit by flickering candlelight, the Hall of Records creates an atmosphere of mystery and introspection, inviting visitors to delve into the secrets held within its pages.

The hum of whispered conversations and the scratching of quills fill the air, forming a symphony of intellectual pursuit.

Secret chambers and hidden alcoves lie concealed within the depths of the Hall, accessible only to those deemed worthy or who possess the right knowledge to navigate its labyrinthine corridors.

It is here that Fama and Barnaby part ways, each shuffling off towards an eclectic gathering of individuals. One surrounded by fellow publicans, the other Fated initiates through and through.

Fama Flintstrike walks with purpose through the labyrinthine corridors of The Hall of Records, his steps silent as he traverses the ancient halls. The glow of candlelight dimly illuminates the countless shelves that hold the weight of knowledge.

As he moves with practiced grace through the corridors of The Hall of Records, Fama melds seamlessly with the shadows that dance behind the flickering lights of every torch and candle. The glow of candlelight dances opposite the rhythm of the shadows it casts. Together, the shadow and its light produce ethereal patterns that seem to shift and play tricks on the eyes.

Finally, after walking past doors adorned with intricate carvings that seem to writhe and shift in the dim light, Fama stops at the mid-point of a hallway. Facing the direction of what seems to be a simple stone wall, he speaks the passphrase assigned to him in the courier's invitation letter, his voice steady and confident. The wall, enchanted with invisible runes, recognizes the words and responds with a low, rumbling creak. Its stones begin to shift and reassemble revealing a hidden chamber beyond.

Fama proceeds, his senses alert, ready to respond to whatever and whomever might surprise him inside.
