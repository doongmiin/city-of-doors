(neutral or chaotic creatures take -2 penalty on CHA, INT and WIS-based checks)

The Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus, sometimes called Nirvana, was an [[Outer Plane]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] representing the alignment of lawful neutral and home of the construct-like geometric [[Modron|modrons]], the law-enforcing inevitables, and the regimented giant ants called formians.

Mechanus is the plane of ultimate law and order, where the souls of people of lawful neutral alignment go after death. Mechanus operates on a strict schedule where every action is planned, measured, and controlled perfectly.
