Deep in the heart of [[Regulus]], there stands a tower that appears to defy all the laws of mechanics. This modron cathedral, as it’s called, reaches far, far into the sky and seems much too slender for its height. Inside, it’s a vast place— much wider, taller, and deeper than its outer dimensions should allow, with a vaulted ceiling that disappears into darkness.

Within this tower is a device that the modrons have been working on for years, and it is said that to look upon their creation is to go mad. According to rumor, [[Primus]] uses this item to keep track of the goings-on across the infinite planes.

The modron cathedral rises out of the central gear of Regulus, not far from *Primus’s Tower*. Surrounded by lesser buildings, it resembles nothing so much as a huge church steeple rising high into the sky. The modron cathedral isn’t nearly as tall as the tales claim, nor is it really bigger on the inside than its outer dimensions would allow. It does seem that way because of some tricks the modrons have played with perspective, but if someone were to measure the entire structure with painstaking accuracy, it would measure up just right.

Modrons are constantly buzzing across the cathedral, keeping it polished, adding fixtures, taking others away, and guarding against intruders. Each visitor wishing to enter must have a pass specifically for the modron cathedral from the *Central Office of Processing and Requests*, and even then an escort consisting of at least two [[Pentadrone|pentadrones]] per person must accompany any such group.

The interior of the cathedral is absolutely huge. The stone walls support vaulted ceilings that seem to spring into the sky, their upper reaches lost in shadows. Balconies on hundreds of floors ring the open space in the center of the structure, and modrons of various ranks constantly move along the balconies on errands.

The central feature of the cathedral’s interior is *The Orrery*, a gigantic device built of constantly moving gears. Spheres inscribed with various symbols rotate about the device’s central point— a needle that rises into the steeple of the cathedral.

The inscriptions on the spheres are in fact the symbols of the planes. The device is actually a working model of the planes, incredibly detailed and infinitely complex. By concentrating on a particular feature of the Orrery as it moves, a viewer can use it as a giant scrying device to view what transpires on the plane corresponding to the chosen point. Of course, the device is fiendishly complex that many a foolish observer has had their wits permanently addled.

The Orrery also has the power of teleportation, though no one except Primus and the [[Secundus|secundi]] knows how to initiate that function. These hierarchs find the device quite useful for planar transport. The modrons, of course, do not allow visitors the time to examine the device, and doing so by stealth is difficult, as neither The Orrery nor visitors are ever unattended.

There are always at least a few modrons perched on the device, swabbing at one surface or another or making precise adjustments. Anyone caught using the Orrery without permission is killed, no questions asked. Few other than modrons even try to use the device anymore because of its reputation for causing insanity.
