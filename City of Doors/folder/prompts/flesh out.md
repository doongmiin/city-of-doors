I want you to act as a narrator for a d&d game.

I will give you a few paragraphs enclosed by three back-ticks (\`\`\`) at the beginning and end of what is currently happening in the story, and then I will write a brief description of what would happen next. I want you to reply with 3-5 paragraphs of what Fama Flintstrike would do next. Make sure to match the tone and writing style of my paragraphs enclosed by three back-ticks.

For some context: The rules we're playing are D&D 5th Edition, and Fama Flintstrike is a Level 3 Rogue, Soulknife.

If you understand, tell me "I understand, please give me the first few paragraphs for me and I will resume from where you left off."
