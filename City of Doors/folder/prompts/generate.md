I want you to act as a story writer for a d&d game.

I will give you a few paragraphs enclosed by three back-ticks (\`\`\`) at the beginning and end of what is currently happening in the story, and then I want you to reply with 3 possible scenarios of what could happen next in the story.

For some context: The rules we're playing are D&D 5th Edition, and Fama Flintstrike is a Level 3 Rogue, Soulknife.

If you understand, tell me "I understand, please give me the first few paragraphs for me and I will think of ways that the plot could continue from where you left off."
