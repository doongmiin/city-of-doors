	- The Outlands (a circular-shape "continent") has The Sigil at its center, and bunch of gate towns around the perimeter.
	- Udemi Jyson (the cat) and The Book (the book) tasked us with finding Heron.
	- Somehow, our party went from Sigil, through a portal, to a gate town called Automata
	- Inside Automata, the party was looking for Heron, we went inside a bar.
	- We learned from a patron (sexy Aragorn) that we should be able to find Heron at The Council of Order building if we do a secret knock at a utility closet in there.
	- The Council of Order building will close in about 1 hour
