	- The Outlands (a circular-shape "continent") has The Sigil at its center, and bunch of gate towns around the perimeter.
	- Udemi Jyson (the cat) and The Book (the book) tasked us with finding Heron.
	- Somehow, our party went from Sigil, through a portal, to a gate town called Automata
	- Inside Automata, the party was looking for Heron, we went inside a bar.
	- We learned from a patron (sexy Aragorn) that we should be able to find Heron at The Council of Order building if we do a secret knock at a utility closet in there.
	- The Council of Order building will close in about 1 hour

	- [[Fama Flintstrike]] grabbed one of the books in [[Heron]]'s magic mansion.
	- The party defended Heron against a band (lead by a female leader)
	- The fight ended when thousands of Modrons began marching into Automata through the Gate to Mechanus (Barnaby knows that this is a bit early for the [[Great Modron March]])
	- The cat rewarded us with the deed to the property where we met him.
		- He said that there is a jink upstairs in the bedroom, there's a loose floorboard under the bed.
	- The party came back to Sigil, we walked into a murder scene (the crowd murmurs thst this was the doing of "the midnight slasher")
	- The victim's corpse has black veins in the shape of spiderwebs protruding from the wound. The wound is a deep gash across the chest, no rigor mortis yet. There is a pool of blood. There is a rusty blade that's probably the murder weapon.
	- Some people with the Harmonium armor (acting as the police force in Sigil) detained our party.
		- Ivan Bennett
		- Enchanted blade, similar to red wizard's blade
		- We are free to go, nut we are instructed to stay in Sigil for 24-48 hours.
	- We arrive at the store and there's 734gp (s)
